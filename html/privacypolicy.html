                            <li>All members need to be aware that when they upload their photos on the Platform, the photos are not only visible to the entire internet community but can also be downloaded, since any image that can be displayed on a computer screen can be saved by the person viewing it. It is technically not possible to prevent this and hence Kikiclick Ads cannot be held liable in such cases. If you are worried about someone else viewing or saving your images then please do not submit them.</li>
